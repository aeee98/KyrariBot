# Kyrari Bot

Made for the Princess Connect ReDive unofficial Discord server because people are asking too many meme questions. The goal of this bot is mostly an excuse for me to develop a easy way to port the tier list. However at the time of writing this is still in the works.

To run this bot, you need the latest version of Python 3/4, and you need the following dependencies:

1. discord.py
2. dotenv
